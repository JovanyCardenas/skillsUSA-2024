# skillsUSA-2024
This is where I have uploaded my SkillsUSA 2024 projects for Regionals, State, and Nationals. I won gold at Regionals and State and went to Nationals.

All these competitions are timed and I have no idea of what kind of project I will do until the beginning of the competition. Some of the projects are not fully completed like the State or Nationals, or they may not work in all cases as this is the original code that I created during the competitions.
